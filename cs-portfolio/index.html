        Hey! Cool. You're looking at the code.
        *That's Great!*
        
        Here's the thing:
        1.  This is a real eportfolio, in which the content
            is (more or less) not just placeholder junk.
            As such, the content, including images, are held in copyright
            by the author, Talus Buchanan Baddley, who reserves all rights thereto.
        
        2.  The structure and style of the website are also copyrighted,
            *but* you may use them in your own work UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:
            
            -   You agree to leave the design notice visible at the bottom of the page;
            -   You agree never to sell this design or use it for any commercial purpose;
            -   If you substantially change the design of the page, beyond minor
                stylistic preferences such as font and color modifications,
                you agree, in mutuality with Talus Baddley, that the design is no longer
                the work of Talus Baddley, and that this agreement is no longer applicable,
                and you agree to remove such notices from the page and source code;
            -   You acknowledge that this code comes with absolutely no warranty of any kind;
            -   You agree to leave these several conditions at the top of the source;  AND,
            -   You agree to require all who receive this design code from you to abide
                by all of these same agreements above.
        
        3.  Have fun!

            <h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
            
            <p>My sudoku solver was originally an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence class. I built it as a command-line Python tool (in order to learn the language).</p>

            <p>The program employs a number of classic AI state-search techniques, including Forward checking, Minimum remaining value, Least constraining value, and Arc consistency. Any combination of these techniques can be turned on, to compare performance. It’s arranged modularly, with different functions loaded based on the chosen techniques.</p>
            
            <div class="inline-image" style="max-width: 590px;">
                <p><img src="visual/sudokui.png" alt="The graphical-interface wrapper on the sudoku solver"></p>
            </div>

            <p>This project goes above and beyond the requirements of the assignment, in both its capabilities and engineering, as a command-line tool. I also wrote a Mac wrapper application in Cocoa to make it easier to use.</p>

            <div class="inline-image" style="max-width: 590px;">
                <p><a href="visual/TechDumpFrontPage.png" target="_blank"><img src="visual/TechDumpFrontPage.png" alt="The glorious Tech Dump front page"></a></p>
                <h5>The glorious Tech Dump front page</h5>
            </div>

            <p>The Tech Dump was a web application designed to help keep track of technologies in a rigorous, relational, consistent way. It was a team project I worked on with Dan Barton for a Databases course.</p>

            <p>We decided to use <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>, and I learned the Rails platform in the process of developing the app. Dan was uncomfortable learning Ruby, however, so he wrote the database wrapper code in Java. We deployed the app (albeit temporarily) in <a href="http://jruby.org">JRuby</a>, to allow for this.</p>

            <div class="inline-image" style="max-width: 590px;">
                <p><a href="visual/ATechnologyPage.png" target="_blank"><img src="visual/ATechnologyPage.png" alt="A Technology Detail page"></a></p>
                <h5>A Technology Detail page</h5>
            </div>

            <p>The app was designed as a publicly-collaborative site, with anybody able to contribute information about literally any technology. The advantage of arranging this in a rigorous database, rather than free-form (as you see on Wikipedia), is that related technologies, parent technologies, and usages of technologies can be connected in a consistent and readily-searchable way. For instance, we developed a thoroughly abstract system of properties that can be defined for a technology, which get inherited from parent technologies and make technologies directly comparable with other related ones (see fig. “A Technology Detail page,” bottom row).</p>

            <p>This project demonstrates</p>

            <ul>
                <li>understanding the concepts and techniques of software design, in how the entire application framework was put together;</li>
                <li>acquiring significant project experience working … in a group setting; and</li>
                <li>developing effective problem solving skills</li>
            </ul>
